Hi!!!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‰

I am a Quality Assurance Engineer with a meticulous and demanding nature that requires me to grow and develop daily in the dynamic field of software testing. My journey began with a passion for HTML, some of my work is presented below. But my real passion is software testing. I love delving into processes and feel truly happy when I find and prevent bugs.
